# iMatrixSpray
### Movement coordinates
The needle moves across the surface thanks to three mechanical arms.
When looking at the iMatrixSpray's plate from above, the X and Y coordinates are respectively the horizontal and vertical axes.
The homing position is at the center of the plate, where both X and Y coordinates are equal to zero. Also the Z coordinate is set to zero, and the needle is 80mm from the ground plate.

* When going up on the Y axis (further from the operator looking at the instrument) the Y coordinate decreases (down to a minimum of -110mm, the washing position on Y), while going down on the Y axis (closer to the operator looking at the instrument) causes the Y coordinate to increase (up to a maximum value of 80mm).
* When going left on the X axis the X coordinate decreases (to a minimum of -60mm), while going right causes the X coordinate to increase (up to a maximum of 60mm).
* Along the Z axis, the Z coordinate decreases when the needle gets closer to the ground plate (down to a minimum of -80, when the needle touches the plate. Avoid to do that!). The Z coordinate at the washing position is equal to -50, while it is set to -35 during the travel. During the spray it is set according to the wish of the user (-80 + height from the ground plate).
